====================
LibravatarPlugin 0.1
====================

About
-----
This will add Libravatar.org (and federated Libravatar instance) support!
    
Enaling this plugin adds Libravatar support, which replaces the
Gravatar functionality which is enabled by default. Libravatar has
a Gravatar fallback, so users without Libravatar accounts but who
do have Gravatar accounts will not notice a change. Libravatar
users will see their Libravatar avatars.
    
This plugin requires PEAR Services_Libravatar to be installed
before avatars will work. If it is not installed, the default
avatar will be shown instead, even if the Gravatar plugin is still
enabled. The Gravatar plugin should be disabled for performance if
this plugin is enabled.

If you are running a very high-traffic statusnet instance and opt
to enable this plugin, you should consider also hosting a CDN mirror
for the Libravatar project.

Lastly, there is a preinclude safety check to avoid log pollution, 
this will be skipped if your php version predates 5.3.2, which will
mean your logs will get spammed if Services_Libravatar is not
correctly installed. Just FYI :)

Configuration
-------------
This plugin requires PEAR Services_Libravatar to be installed:
  pear install services_libravatar

Before enabling this plugin, add this to your config.php:
  addPlugin('Libravatar', array());

Performance hints:

Disabling the Gravatar plugin will reduce processing load; they are
not compatible. Gravatar will not work if this plugin is enabled
(except by the fallback mechanism), so there's no point in keeping
it on.

You can reduce filesystem hits by removing the pre-include safety
check by adding the following to your config.php:
  $config['Libravatar']['nocheck'] = true;
