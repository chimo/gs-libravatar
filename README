====================
LibravatarPlugin
====================

About
-----
This will add Libravatar.org (and federated Libravatar instance) support!

Libravatar has a Gravatar fallback, so users without Libravatar accounts
but who do have Gravatar accounts will not notice a change. Libravatar
users will see their Libravatar avatars.

If you are running a very high-traffic GNU social instance and opt
to enable this plugin, you should consider also hosting a CDN mirror
for the Libravatar project.

Configuration
-------------
Before enabling this plugin, add this to your config.php:
  addPlugin('Libravatar');

Performance hints:

Disabling the Gravatar plugin will reduce processing load; they are
not compatible. Gravatar will not work if this plugin is enabled
(except by the fallback mechanism), so there's no point in keeping
it on.

Same thing we do every night, Pinky.
